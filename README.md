# Daily DSA Problem Solving in Java

This repository contains my daily problem-solving journey using Java. I solve problems from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and other platforms to sharpen my DSA and problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ“… Daily Commitment
- At least 1 DSA problem solved per day.
- Organized by topic and patterns for easy revision.
- Real-world explanations and approach included wherever possible.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Organization
- `Patterns/` â€“ Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search, etc.
- `Arrays/`, `Strings/`, `Tree/`, `Graph/` â€“ Topic-wise solutions.
- `Daily/` â€“ Chronological log of daily solved problems.

## ðŸ§  Skills Sharpened
- Problem-solving with Java
- Efficient algorithm design
- Pattern recognition
- Interview prep for companies like Amazon, Google, etc.

## âœ… Sample Problem Format
```java
// Problem: Two Sum
// Platform: LeetCode
// Approach: HashMap
// Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
