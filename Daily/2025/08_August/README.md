📅 01/08/2025 — [118. Pascal's Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)  
**Level**: Easy  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Dynamic Programming (Build row by row)  

- Goal: Generate the first `numRows` of Pascal’s Triangle.  
- Each row starts and ends with `1`.  
- Middle elements are formed by summing the two numbers directly above it (from the previous row).  

**Steps**:  
1. Initialize the triangle as a list of lists.  
2. Add the first row `[1]`.  
3. For each new row:  
   - Start with `1`.  
   - Fill middle values by summing adjacent elements from the previous row.  
   - End with `1`.  
4. Append the row to the triangle.  

**Time Complexity**: O(N²) — where N is `numRows`.  
**Space Complexity**: O(N²) — storing all rows of the triangle.  

💡 *Classic DP problem: each element is derived from the two numbers above it. The beauty lies in its simplicity and symmetry.*

📅 02/08/2025 — [2561. Rearranging Fruits](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearranging-fruits/)  
**Level**: Hard  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Frequency Map + Greedy + Sorting  

- Goal: Make `basket1` and `basket2` identical with minimum cost by swapping elements.  
- A valid solution exists only if the frequency difference for each fruit is even (otherwise return `-1`).  
- Use a frequency map to calculate the net imbalance of each fruit between baskets.  
- Collect the extra fruits into a list `merge`.  
- Sort `merge` and for the cheaper half, compute the cost of fixing imbalance.  
- Cost is the minimum between:  
  - Swapping directly with the other basket (`merge.get(i)`), or  
  - Using the smallest fruit value (`2 * minValue`) as a "proxy swap".  

**Steps**:  
1. Count frequency difference of each fruit between `basket1` and `basket2`.  
2. If any difference is odd → return `-1` (impossible).  
3. Build a list of excess fruits to be swapped.  
4. Sort the list to prioritize cheaper swaps.  
5. For each fruit in the cheaper half of the list, add the minimum of `fruit` vs `2 * minValue` to result.  

**Time Complexity**: O(N log N) — due to sorting the extra fruits.  
**Space Complexity**: O(N) — for frequency map and merge list.  

💡 *The trick lies in considering both direct swaps and proxy swaps through the global minimum fruit for lower cost.*

📅 03/08/2025 — [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)  
**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Sliding Window + HashMap  

- Goal: Find the longest subarray where there are at most 2 distinct fruit types.  
- This is equivalent to finding the longest subarray with at most 2 distinct integers.  
- Use a sliding window with a HashMap to track fruit counts.  
- Shrink the window from the left whenever more than 2 distinct fruits appear.  

**Steps**:  
1. Initialize `left = 0`, `max = 1`, and an empty map.  
2. Expand the right pointer and add fruits to the map.  
3. If map size exceeds 2, shrink the window by moving `left` until size ≤ 2.  
4. Update `max` with the largest window size found.  
5. Return `max`.  

**Time Complexity**: O(N) — each element is processed at most twice (left & right pointers).  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) — since the map holds at most 2 fruit types.  

💡 *Classic sliding window problem where the key is controlling the number of distinct items in the window.*

📅 04/08/2025 — [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)  
**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Sliding Window + HashMap  

- Goal: Find the length of the longest subarray containing at most 2 distinct fruit types.  
- Use a sliding window to dynamically maintain a valid range.  
- HashMap keeps track of the frequency of each fruit type.  
- Shrink the window from the left whenever the basket has more than 2 fruit types.  

**Steps**:  
1. Start with `left = 0`, `max = 1`, and an empty HashMap.  
2. Expand the window by moving `right` and update fruit counts in the map.  
3. If more than 2 distinct fruits exist, shrink the window by moving `left`.  
4. Update `max` with the size of the largest valid window.  
5. Return `max`.  

**Time Complexity**: O(N) — both pointers move at most N steps.  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) — map holds at most 2 fruit types.  

💡 *Same logic as Day 3 — repeated to strengthen sliding window mastery.*

📅 05/08/2025 — [3477. Fruits Into Baskets II (Unplaced Fruits)](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unplaced-fruits/)  
**Level**: Easy  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Greedy Placement  

- Goal: Determine how many fruits cannot be placed into baskets.  
- Each fruit can only go into the **first basket** whose capacity is ≥ fruit size.  
- Once a basket is used, it becomes unavailable (`capacity = 0`).  
- If no valid basket is found, the fruit is counted as **unplaced**.  

**Steps**:  
1. Initialize `count = 0`.  
2. For each fruit:  
   - Scan baskets sequentially.  
   - If basket capacity ≥ fruit, place fruit and mark basket as used (`0`).  
   - Otherwise, if no basket fits, increment `count`.  
3. Return total `count`.  

**Time Complexity**: O(N × M) — where N = number of fruits, M = number of baskets (worst case scan per fruit).  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) — in-place update of baskets array.  

💡 *A straightforward greedy approach: always attempt to place each fruit in the first suitable basket; leftover fruits are the answer.*

📅 06/08/2025 — [3489. Fruits Into Baskets III (Unplaced Fruits, Optimized)](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unplaced-fruits-ii/)  
**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Square Root Decomposition + Greedy  

- Goal: Place fruits into baskets (each basket can hold only one fruit if capacity ≥ fruit size) and count how many fruits remain unplaced.  
- Instead of scanning all baskets for every fruit (O(N × M)), divide baskets into **blocks** using √N decomposition.  
- Maintain `maxV[sec]` = maximum capacity in each block to quickly skip irrelevant sections.  
- Only when a block might fit the fruit, scan inside it to find the exact basket.  
- Update both `baskets[]` and `maxV[]` after each placement.  

**Steps**:  
1. Partition baskets into blocks of size `√N`.  
2. Precompute the maximum basket capacity in each block.  
3. For each fruit:  
   - Check blocks sequentially.  
   - If block max < fruit → skip block.  
   - Else scan inside block, place fruit in first valid basket, update `maxV`.  
4. If no basket fits, increment `count`.  

**Time Complexity**: O(N√N) worst case — block scanning reduces unnecessary checks.  
**Space Complexity**: O(√N) — extra array `maxV` for block maximums.  

💡 *Improves upon the naive greedy by skipping over irrelevant blocks using sqrt decomposition, making it faster for large input sizes.*

📅 07/08/2025 — [3363. Max Collected Fruits](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-collected-fruits/)  
**Level**: Hard  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Dynamic Programming + Matrix Transpose  

- Goal: Collect maximum fruits along specific matrix paths.  
- First, collect the diagonal fruits (`fruits[i][i]`).  
- Then compute maximum path sum using DP on the upper-right part of the matrix.  
- Transpose the matrix and repeat DP on the new structure to capture symmetric paths.  
- Add up all collected fruits for the final result.  

**Steps**:  
1. Initialize `ans` with diagonal fruits sum.  
2. Define a DP function:  
   - `prev[]` keeps best path values from previous row.  
   - For each position `(i, j)`, compute the best from left, right, or same column of previous row.  
   - Add current fruit value.  
3. Run DP once on original matrix.  
4. Transpose the matrix (swap `fruits[i][j]` with `fruits[j][i]`).  
5. Run DP again and add to `ans`.  
6. Return `ans`.  

**Time Complexity**: O(N²) — traversing the matrix twice with DP.  
**Space Complexity**: O(N) — for DP arrays (`prev`, `curr`).  

💡 *Key insight: solve once on the matrix, then transpose and repeat to capture both directional contributions.*

📅 08/08/2025 — [808. Soup Servings](https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/)  
**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Dynamic Programming (Probability States)  

- Goal: Given two types of soup (A and B) with `n ml` each, find the probability that soup A becomes empty first (plus half the probability that both A and B become empty at the same time).  
- Reduce the problem by dividing soup into units of 25 ml (since all operations serve multiples of 25).  
- Define `dp[i][j]` = probability when A has `i` units and B has `j` units left.  
- Transitions consider 4 serving operations:  
  1. Serve 100 ml A, 0 ml B  
  2. Serve 75 ml A, 25 ml B  
  3. Serve 50 ml A, 50 ml B  
  4. Serve 25 ml A, 75 ml B  
- Base cases:  
  - `dp[0][0] = 0.5` (both empty at same time).  
  - `dp[0][j] = 1.0` (A empty first).  
  - `dp[i][0] = 0.0` (B empty first).  
- Stop early if probability approaches 1.  

**Steps**:  
1. Convert `n` to `m = ceil(n / 25)`.  
2. Initialize DP maps with base cases.  
3. Iteratively compute probabilities using transition formula.  
4. Stop if diagonal probability (`dp[k][k]`) is very close to 1.  
5. Return `dp[m][m]`.  

**Time Complexity**: O(N² / 625) — since problem is scaled down by 25.  
**Space Complexity**: O(N² / 625) — storing DP states.  

💡 *The trick is scaling the problem into 25 ml units and using DP to compute probabilities efficiently.*

📅 09/08/2025 — [231. Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)  
**Level**: Easy  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Bit Manipulation  

- Goal: Check if a given integer `n` is a power of two.  
- Key property: A power of two has exactly **one set bit** in its binary representation.  
- Trick: `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` is true **only when `n` is a power of two** (and `n > 0`).  
  - Example:  
    - `n = 8 → (1000 & 0111) = 0000 → true`  
    - `n = 12 → (1100 & 1011) = 1000 → false`  

**Steps**:  
1. Return `false` if `n < 1`.  
2. Use the condition `(n & (n - 1)) == 0`.  
3. Return the result.  

**Time Complexity**: O(1) — single bitwise operation.  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) — constant extra space.  

💡 *The trick is using bitwise AND to eliminate the lowest set bit and check if only one exists.*

**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Digit Frequency Matching  

- Goal: Check if the digits of `n` can be reordered to form a power of 2.  
- Count the frequency of digits in `n`.  
- Iterate through all powers of 2 up to `2^30`.  
- For each power, compare its digit frequency with `n`.  
- If any match, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.  

**Steps**:  
1. Create a digit count array for `n`.  
2. Loop over powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^30`.  
3. For each, count its digits and compare with `n`.  
4. If equal → valid reorder found.  
5. Else return false.  

**Time Complexity**: O(31 * d) ≈ O(1) — only 31 checks with at most 10 digits.  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) — fixed digit count arrays.  

💡 *The trick is digit-count comparison instead of generating all permutations.*

- Goal: Find the product of powers of two (from the binary form of `n`) within each query range `[l, r]`, modulo 10⁹+7.  
- Convert `n` into its power-of-two components based on set bits.  
- For each query, multiply elements in the given range and take modulo at each step.  
- Return all query results in an array.  

**Steps**:  
1. Decompose `n` into powers of two and store in a list.  
2. For each query `[start, end]`, multiply powers in that range.  
3. Apply modulo after every multiplication.  
4. Store and return results for all queries.  

**Time Complexity**: O(Q × K) — K is the number of set bits in `n`.  
**Space Complexity**: O(K) — storing powers of two.  

💡 *Binary decomposition avoids recalculating powers, making queries efficient.*

**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Dynamic Programming (Subset Sum with Powers)  

- Goal: Count the number of ways to represent `n` as the sum of unique integers raised to the power `x`, modulo 10⁹+7.  
- Treat the problem like a **subset-sum** variant where each number `i` contributes `i^x`.  
- Use DP to decide whether to include or exclude each power in the sum.  
- Return the total ways to form `n`.  

**Steps**:  
1. Initialize a DP table `dp[i][j]` = number of ways to form sum `j` using powers up to `i^x`.  
2. Base case: `dp[0][0] = 1` (one way to form 0).  
3. For each number `i` from 1 to `n`, compute `val = i^x`.  
4. For each sum `j`, carry over `dp[i-1][j]` (exclude) and add `dp[i-1][j - val]` (include if possible).  
5. Take modulo at every addition and return `dp[n][n]`.  

**Time Complexity**: O(n²) — nested loops over numbers and possible sums.  
**Space Complexity**: O(n²) — DP table of size (n+1) × (n+1).  

💡 *This is a power-based variation of the classic subset-sum dynamic programming problem.*
