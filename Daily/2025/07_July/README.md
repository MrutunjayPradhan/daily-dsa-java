**Approach**:
- Divide array into three equal parts (length = 3n).
- Use a max heap to track minimum sum of the left part (first 2n elements) while removing elements.
- Use a min heap to track maximum sum of the right part (last 2n elements) similarly.
- Precompute prefix sums for left part (`part1`) by always removing the largest element.
- Precompute suffix sums for right part (`part2`) by always removing the smallest element.
- Calculate minimal difference of `part1[i] - part2[i]` for all valid splits.

**Language**: Java  
**Approach**:
- Used a **`HashSet`** to store all folder paths for O(1) prefix lookup.
- For each folder:
  - Iteratively stripped the path backward (`/` split) to check if any **parent folder** exists.
  - If found, marked it as a **sub-folder**.
- Only folders with **no valid parent in the set** are added to the result.

**Time Complexity**: O(NÂ·L)  
(where N = number of folders, L = average length of folder path)  
**Space Complexity**: O(N)

ðŸ’¡ *Avoids sorting or trie-based approaches by directly checking parent prefixes.*

**Level**: Hard  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**:
- Build a Trie from folder paths.
- Serialize each subtree using post-order DFS (e.g., `folder(child1(serial1)child2(serial2))`).
- Use a `HashMap<String, Integer>` to track frequency of each serialized subtree.
- In a second DFS, skip adding subtrees that occur more than once (i.e., duplicates).
- Return non-duplicate paths.

**Language**: Java  
**Approach**:
- Use a **`StringBuilder`** to construct the result.
- Always add the first two characters (as they can't form a triple).
- From the 3rd character onward, check:
  - If it forms a **triple consecutive repetition** (`aaa`, `bbb`, etc.)
  - Skip if true, else add to result.
- Efficiently checks last two characters using `sb.charAt()`.

**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Sliding Window + HashSet  
- Maintain a window `[j...i]` where all elements are **unique**.
- Use `HashSet` to track seen elements.
- Move `i` forward when the current number is not in the set (expand window).
- If duplicate found, move `j` forward and subtract from `sum` until duplicate is removed (shrink window).
- Update `maxVal` with current window sum at each step.

**Time Complexity**: O(N)

**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Greedy + Counting  
- All operations convert any `00` into `10`.
- Idea is to push all `0`s towards right greedily.
- Count number of `0`s after the first `0` (letâ€™s say `zeroCount`).
- First `0` becomes `1`, then next `zeroCount - 1` `0`s become `1`, and one `0` will remain and get converted to `0` at correct place.

**Steps**:
- Traverse the string.
- Count how many `0`s are there and where the first `0` occurs.
- Construct result string:
  - From start to `firstZeroIndex`: all `1`s
  - Then one `0` followed by `zeroCount - 1` `1`s
  - Remaining suffix (rest of string): all `1`s

**Time Complexity**: O(N)  
**Space Complexity**: O(N)

**Level**: Hard  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: DFS + Subtree XOR + Bit Manipulation  
- We are given a tree and need to remove two edges to split it into three components.
- Score = max XOR among the three components - min XOR.
- Use DFS to compute XOR values of all subtrees from node 0.
- For each pair of edges, remove them and calculate XORs of resulting components.
- Try all pairs of edges (at most 4950 since max 100 nodes) and track minimum score.

**Steps**:
1. Build an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. DFS from node 0 to compute the XOR of all nodes in each subtree.
3. For each pair of edges:
   - Simulate removal of two edges.
   - Identify the resulting three components.
   - Compute XOR for each component.
4. Calculate score and track the minimum.

**Time Complexity**: O(NÂ²)  
**Space Complexity**: O(N)

**Language**: Java  
**Approach**: Set + Filtering + Sum  
- Goal: From the array `nums`, return the **sum of all distinct positive integers**.
- We discard all negative or zero values and duplicates.
- To efficiently remove duplicates, use a `Set<Integer>`.
- Then sum all positive values in the set.

**Steps**:
1. Traverse the array.
2. Add only `num > 0` to the set.
3. Sum all integers from the set using stream API.

**Time Complexity**: O(N)  
**Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the set

ðŸ’¡ *Simple filtering task where the key is ensuring uniqueness and positivity before summing.*
