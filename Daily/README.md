- At each event:
  - Either skip the current event
  - Or attend it and move to the next non-overlapping event found via binary search

**Level**: Medium  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**:
- Sort all meetings by start time
- Maintain two priority queues:
  - `unusedRooms` → rooms free and available immediately
  - `usedRooms` → rooms currently occupied, ordered by end time
- For each meeting:
  - Release rooms whose end time ≤ current meeting’s start
  - If a room is available, schedule the meeting there
  - Otherwise, delay the meeting until the next room is free
- Count the number of meetings per room
- Return the room used most frequently (smallest index if tie)

**Time Complexity**: O(m log n), where m = number of meetings  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### 📅 12/07/2025 — [1900. The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-and-latest-rounds-where-players-compete/)
**Level**: Hard  
**Language**: Java  
**Approach**:
- Define DP state `F(n, f, s)` = earliest round where players `f` and `s` meet in a tournament of size `n`
- Handle symmetry:
  - `F(n, f, s) = F(n, s, f)`
  - If `f + s > n + 1` → mirror positions to reduce DP states
- Split into:
  - Players on left half
  - Players on right half
- Recursively compute for smaller tournaments
- Track both:
  - Earliest round
  - Latest round

**Time Complexity**: Exponential, but acceptable for `n ≤ 29` due to memoization  
**Space Complexity**: O(n³) DP table
